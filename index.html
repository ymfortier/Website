<!-- Hello there -->

  <h1>Secwépemc’ulucw - My Homeland</h1>
  </header>

  <div class=container 1><h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Yvonne Fortier</strong>, a member of the Tk'emlups te Secwépemc, with my roots entrenched in Chu Chua, where I spent my childhood. I am Secwépemc (Shuswap) and my people live in a vast territory in the south central part of the province of British Columbia; covering approximately 180,000 square km. The landscape is everchanging - mountains, lakes, rivers, creeks, forests, desert lands, and the natural wonders of Mother Nature.</p>
  <p>I have travelled to places such as Singapore, Sydney, Manchester, London, Dublin, Los Angelos, Las Vegas, and loved sightseeing and experiencing the different cultures. My favorite trip was to the Grand Canyon, one of the world's 7 wonders. Now I want to explore my homeland - Secwépemc’ulucw, and visit the places my parents and Elders shared in their stories. This is just the start, as there are many areas I want to see. I acknowledge the people whose footsteps I may follow, and respect all the living beings around me. <strong>Welcome</strong> to the land of the Secwepemc (<i>usually drummers and singers welcome you to their land with the Welcome Song as you enter their territory</i>). <i>Click on the audio controls below to listen to the Welcome Song by the late Nels Mitchell (@Secwepemc Cultural Education Society)</p>

  <div class=container 3><h2>1. North Thompson Valley - Heli Tour</h2>

  <p>One of my dreams is to book a helicopter tour of the North Thompson Valley, as I understand it is a breath-taking scenic tour and an experience like no other. I have a healthy respect, and at times a <em>fear</em>, of extreme heights such as Mount Robson offers; however, I am sure I will overcome that <em>fear</em> and enjoy my tour. I do not think photos could do justice to the immense and beautiful North Thompson Valley, so I would like to share a link to a video on YouTube, copywritten to the North Thompson Valley.

  <div class=container 4><h2>2. Helmcken Falls</h2>

  <p>The Helmcken Falls are located within the Simpcw First Nation's traditional territory. The <a href="http://www.simpcw.com" target="_blank">Simpcw</a> inhabit <i>Simpcwulecw</i>, an area now known in English as the <i>North Thompson</i>. Helmcken Falls is the fourth highest waterfall in Canada at 141 m (463 ft).

  <div class=container 5><h2>3. Mount Robson</h2>

  <p>Mount Robson is the highest point in the Canadian Rockies, and is the second highest peak in B.C., at 2,975m (9,760 ft). There are only about 10% successful climbs to the top of Mount Robson, as there is no easy way to the summit and bad weather can be a deterrent.

  <div class=container 7><h2>5. Coyote Rock</h2>

  <p>Located within the Skeetchestn Indian Band's traditional territory. The "Coyote Rock" holds cultural significance and is also known as a balancing rock. In the past similar rocks existed throughout the larger Secwepemc Nation, and it is believed the rocks were put there by Grandfather Coyote to delienate territories. </p>
