  <h2>Following the footsteps of my ancestors in Secwépemc’ulucw - the land of the Secwepemc</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Yvonne Fortier</strong>, a member of the Tk'emlups te Secwépemc, with my roots entrenched in Chu Chua, where I spent my childhood. I am Secwepemc (Shuswap) and my people live within a vast territory in the south central part of the province of British Columbia; approximately 180,000 square km. The landscape is everchanging - mountains, lakes, rivers, creeks, forests, desert lands,and the natural wonders of Mother Nature.
  </p>

  <p>I have travelled to places such as Singapore, Sydney, Manchester, London, Dublin, Los Angelos, Las Vegas, and loved sightseeing and experiencing different cultures. Now I want to explore my homelands - <em>Secwépemc’ulucw</em>, and places my parents and Elders shared in their stories. I acknowledge the people whose footsteps I may follow, and respect all the living beings around me.</p>

<p>Welcome to the land of the Secwepemc; usually drummers and singers welcome you to their land with the Welcome Song.  The following audio clip is by the late Nels Mitchell, singing <i>The Welcome Song</i> in Secwépemctsin.

<h3>1. North Thompson Valley - Heli Tour</h3>
<p>One of my dreams is to book a helicopter tour of the North Thompson Valley, as I understand it is a breath-taking scenic tour and an experience like no other. I have a healthy respect, and at times fear, for extreme heights such as Mount Robson offers; however, I am sure I will overcome that fear and enjoy my tour.</p>
<p>I do not think photos could do justice to the immense and beautiful North Thompson Valley, so I would like to share a link to a video on YouTube, copywritten to the North Thompson Valley
